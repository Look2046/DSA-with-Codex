# HANDOFF

Use this file for end-of-day handoff. Add one new section per day (latest first).

## 2026-03-03 (L-03 animation savepoint, pending 2 bugs)

### Today Done
- Completed major L-03 UI/animation refinement on `feat/l03-v1`:
  - split-node visual + HEAD pointer semantics
  - staged insert animation flow refinement
  - improved arrow sync during movement/reset
  - insert index input switched to "before index" semantics (1-based in UI)

### Current State
- Branch: `feat/l03-v1`
- Working tree status: expected clean after savepoint commit
- Quality gate: `npm run check` passed

### Remaining Issues (confirmed by manual test)
- Bug 1: after `find` finishes, UI should explicitly show the matched result index (or not-found feedback with index context).
- Bug 2: `delete` behavior is incorrect in UI flow; user-observed behavior currently resembles insert flow and needs dedicated deletion playback verification/fix.

### First Step Next Session
```bash
git -C /home/haoyu/data-structure-algorithm-visualizor switch feat/l03-v1
```

### Next 3 Tasks
- Add explicit find-result output (matched index / not found) in linked-list page status area.
- Re-test and fix delete playback data flow + rendering path so it is fully distinct from insert.
- Run `npm run check` and commit focused bugfix patch.

## 2026-03-03 (L-01 milestone closed)

### Today Done
- Completed L-01 array module v1 on `feat/l01-v1`.
- Added array insert step generator and tests (deterministic, final state, tail insert, out-of-range guard, explicit empty-slot behavior).
- Reworked L-01 playback to make insertion process explicit: append empty slot, shift with visible hole movement, prepare insert, then insert.
- Added zh/en localized copy and UI polish for L-01 interaction and visualization.
- Passed local quality gate and pushed branch updates (`npm run check`).

### Current State
- Branch: `feat/l01-v1`
- Working tree status: expected clean after final push
- Milestone status: L-01 v1 closed and pushed

### Blockers / Risks
- No blocker for entering L-03.
- Risk: L-03 should follow existing playback conventions to avoid introducing a separate animation model.

### First Step Tomorrow
```bash
git -C /home/haoyu/data-structure-algorithm-visualizor switch -c feat/l03-v1
```

### Next 3 Tasks
- Start L-03 linked list v1 with one core operation (insert first).
- Reuse playback store + timeline controls from S-01/L-01.
- Keep `npm run check` green before every push.

## 2026-03-03 (S-01 milestone closed)

### Today Done
- Completed M0 scaffold (Vite + React + TypeScript + route shell).
- Completed M1 foundations (types, module registry, playback store).
- Completed M2 first vertical slice for S-01 (bubble sort steps, playback, bars/highlights, speed/data-size controls, zh/en UI text).
- Completed M3 quality gates (`npm run check`, unit tests, CI workflow).

### Current State
- Branch: `feat/m0-scaffold`
- Working tree status: clean
- Milestone status: S-01 + M3 closed and pushed

### Blockers / Risks
- No blocker for entering L-01.
- Risk: L-01 implementation should reuse existing playback patterns to avoid divergent architecture.

### First Step Tomorrow
```bash
git -C /home/haoyu/data-structure-algorithm-visualizor switch -c feat/l01-v1
```

### Next 3 Tasks
- Start L-01 v1 implementation (array operation steps + playback).
- Reuse current store/playback infrastructure from S-01.
- Keep passing `npm run check` before each push.

## 2026-03-03 (Pre-code readiness)

### Today Done
- Added pre-code readiness docs: `PRE_CODE_CHECKLIST.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md`.
- Frozen V1 scope and recorded it in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Upgraded `TODO.md` to `P0/P1/P2` with DoD and acceptance criteria.
- Completed Go/No-Go checklist for entering `feat/m0-scaffold`.

### Current State
- Branch: `docs/pre-code-readiness`
- Working tree status: docs updates in progress
- Next milestone: start coding on `feat/m0-scaffold`

### Blockers / Risks
- No blockers on planning side.
- Risk: implementation may diverge from routing/state docs if M0 scope is exceeded.

### First Step Tomorrow
```bash
git -C /home/haoyu/data-structure-algorithm-visualizor switch -c feat/m0-scaffold
```

### Next 3 Tasks
- Initialize frontend scaffold (Vite + React + TypeScript).
- Register P0 routes and placeholder pages.
- Add baseline lint/test scripts and run local checks.

## 2026-03-03

### Today Done
- Initialized project documentation baseline.
- Configured GitHub SSH authentication for reliable push from WSL.

### Current State
- Branch: `main`
- Working tree status: clean
- Last verified command: `git push --dry-run` (success)

### Blockers / Risks
- No active blockers.

### First Step Tomorrow
```bash
git -C /home/haoyu/data-structure-algorithm-visualizor pull
```

### Next 3 Tasks
- Create initial scaffold for frontend app.
- Define first visualized data structure module scope.
- Set up lint/test scripts.
